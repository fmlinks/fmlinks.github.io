Hello there! I'm Fengming Lin (林枫茗).

As a PhD student in [CISTIB](https://www.cistib.org/members) at School of Computing, University of Leeds, I'm fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Alejandro Frangi](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/alejandro-frangi), alongside [Dr. Nishant Ravikumar](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/1846/dr-nishant-ravikumar) and [Dr. Yan Xia](https://www.yannxia.com/). I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University(Project 211, Project 985), China. During my master period, I was supervised by [Prof. Ju Liu](https://brain.sdu.edu.cn/en/info/1090/1163.htm) and [Dr. Qiang Wu](https://brain.sdu.edu.cn/en/info/1090/1115.htm).

Research
======
My research area is in artificial intelligence (AI) for Medical Image Analysis. Specifically, I focus on developing automatic pipeline for in-silico clinical trials. e.g., attention model, class imbalanced learning, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, domain generalization, multi-modality learning, and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).

News
======
[02/2024] Four papers were accepted by ISBI 2024.

[05/2023] Joint 1st place in [SHINY-ICARUS challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn45774070/wiki/619953) in ISBI 2023.
