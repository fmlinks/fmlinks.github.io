Hello there! I'm Fengming Lin (林枫茗).

As a PhD student in [CISTIB](https://www.cistib.org/members) at [School of Computing, University of Leeds](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing), I'm fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Alejandro Frangi](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/alejandro-frangi), alongside [Dr. Nishant Ravikumar](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/1846/dr-nishant-ravikumar) and [Dr. Yan Xia](https://www.yannxia.com/). I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in [School of Information Science and Engineering](https://www.ise.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/)(Project 211, Project 985), China. During my master period, I was supervised by [Prof. Ju Liu](https://brain.sdu.edu.cn/en/info/1090/1163.htm) and [Dr. Qiang Wu](https://brain.sdu.edu.cn/en/info/1090/1115.htm).
